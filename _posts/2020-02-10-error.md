##### 解决 fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/homebrew/brew/' 问题

```
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

##### 解决 Mac高版本Homebrew 问题

```
Error: Running Homebrew as root is extremely dangerous and no longer supported.
As Homebrew does not drop privileges on installation you would be giving all
build scripts full access to your system.
```

```
# 卸载旧版本brew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"

# 安装最新版本brew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
